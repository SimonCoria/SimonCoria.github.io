## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

Lab 1 

Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because this lab introduced me to C++. This lab was more about explaining what the course was going to be like and I enjoyed it because it gave me something to look forward to. I was also introduced to a few classmates that helped me throughout the semester.
