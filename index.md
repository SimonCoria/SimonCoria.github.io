Hi my name is Simon I am a computer science: cyber security major at CSUF I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

Lab 1 

* Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because this lab introduced me to C++. This lab was more about explaining what the course was going to be like and I enjoyed it because it gave me something to look forward to. I was also introduced to a few classmates that helped me throughout the semester.

Lab 7

* Lab 7 was also one of my favorite labs because we based our code on whether or not you were able to park somewhere based on the sign. While working in this lab I also gained a greater understanding on how these signs work in the real world. Me and my partner did however struggle on aligning all the valid times to park but we were able to solve the issue in the end.

Lab 8

* Lab 8 part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because it was fun but also challenging at the same time. We had to figure out how to store the lowest score and the highest score to help find the average judge score. The part that was most difficult was figuring out and understanding how to change the stored number.
